This repository contains data from a project that examines how structural features of political institutions affect the effectiveness of government responses 
to COVID-19.

Based on the centripetal theory developed by John Gerring and Strom Thacker (2008), I compiled an original dataset of centripetal scores of 122 electoral democracies. 
I expanded and improved Gerring and Thacker's original dataset by using the most recent sources and adding an indicator of party organization. As constitutions
may not fully reflect how political actors interact and how policies are made in practice, particularly in countries with weak institutions, 
Gerring and Thacker use the moving sum from 1900 to the observation year with a 1% annual depreciation rate as the adjusted final score, assuming that
newly established institutions take time to begin structuring the actions and expectations of political actors. I take a different approach by multiplying the
raw score with the Corruption Perceptions Index on the grounds that the absence of corruption reflects the strengths of institutions in a country.
